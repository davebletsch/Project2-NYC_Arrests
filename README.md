# Project2-NYC_Arrests

This is the second of three projects for my Python for Data Analytics class at CUNY LaGuardia CC. 

The objective was to use the publicly available NYPD Arrest data from the city's website (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Arrest-Data-Year-to-Date-/uip8-fykc) and complete the following tasks:
1. Select a subset of the total dataset (ZIP code, precinct, borough, etc.) as a starting point.
2. Perform at least one data cleaning task.
3. Generate at least one descriptive statistic.
4. Compare this subset to some other entity.
5. Generate at least one visualization.
6. Include a conclusion of the analysis.
